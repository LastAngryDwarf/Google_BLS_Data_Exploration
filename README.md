# Google BLS Data Exploration
This is my Capstone Project for the Google Certificate in Data Analytics.  

Welcome. I am wrapping up a first draft of the capstone project for the Google Certificate in Data Analytics.

Go ahead and open the .html file "10_bls_casestudy_v2" in your broswer to take a look at the progress so far.  
If (for some bizarre reason) you want to check out the data I used, it's in the zipped folder called "data".  
If you want to look at the random assortment of code I used, that's 01_data_exploration.  
If you want to see the markdown file, that's 10.bls_casestudy_v2.rmd.

I'll add more and change up this readme as I go along.
